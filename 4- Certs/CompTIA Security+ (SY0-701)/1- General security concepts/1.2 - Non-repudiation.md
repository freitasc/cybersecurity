## What is it?

- You can't deny what you've said
	- There is no taking back
- Sign a contract
	- Your signature adds non-repudiation
	- You really did sign the contract
	- Others can see your signature as proof
- Adds a different perspective for cryptography
	- Proof of integrity
	- Proof of origin, with high assurance of authenticity

## Additional Information

- ### Proof of integrity
	- Verify data does not change
	- In cryptography, we use a hash
	- If the data changes, the hash changes almost completely, easily checkable 
	- Doesn't necessarily associate data with an individual

- ### Proof of origin
	- Prove the message was not changed: ==INTEGRITY==
	- Prove the source of the message: ==AUTHENTICATION==
	- Make sure the signature isn't fake
	- #### ==THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE THIS IS USING PKs==
		- Sign with the private key
			- The message doesn't need to be encrypted
			- Nobody else can sign this
		- Verify with the public key
			- Any change to the message will invalidate the signature
