## What is it?

- A distributed ledger that keeps track of transactions
- Everyone on the blockchain network maintains the ledger
- Many practical applications
	- Payment processing
	- Digital ID
	- Supply chain monitoring
	- Digital voting
## Additional Information

- #### Core Concept
    - It is a **distributed, immutable ledger** that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a network.
    - "Distributed" means no single entity owns it; "Immutable" means once something is written, it cannot be changed or deleted.
- #### The Structure
    - **Block**: Contains data (e.g., transaction details), a unique **Hash**, and the **Hash of the previous block**.
    - **Hash**: A digital fingerprint. If you change anything inside the block, the hash changes completely.
    - **The Chain**: Each block points to the one before it. If a block is tampered with, all subsequent blocks become invalid because their "previous hash" no longer matches.
- #### Decentralization
    - Operates on a **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) network**.
    - Every node (computer) in the network has a full copy of the ledger.
    - Eliminates the "Middleman" (like a bank or a central server).
- #### Consensus Mechanisms
    - How the network agrees on the "truth" without a leader.
    - **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Miners solve complex math problems to validate blocks (e.g., Bitcoin). High energy usage.
    - **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Validators are chosen based on the number of coins they "stake" (e.g., Ethereum 2.0). More energy-efficient.
- #### Smart Contracts
    - Programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met.
    - Code is Law
    - Used for DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs, and automated supply chains.
- #### Key Properties
    - **Transparency**: Anyone can view the transaction history on public chains (e.g., via Etherscan).
    - **Security**: To hack it, you'd need to control 51% of the entire network's power (a "51% attack"), which is practically impossible for large chains.
    - **Anonymity vs. Pseudonymity**: Users are identified by wallet addresses (0x...), not necessarily their real names, though their actions are public.
