Tags: [[Certificates]], [[CVE-2014-0160]], [[Asymmetric-Encryption]]

## What is it?

- A public key certificate
	- Binds a public key with a digital signature
	- And other details about the key holder
- A digital signature adds trust
	- PKI uses Certificate Authorities for additional trust
	- Web of Trust adds other users for additional trust
- Certificate creation can be built into the OS
	- Part of Windows Domain services
	- Many 3rd-party options

## Additional Information

- #### ==X.509==
	- Standard industry format for all digital certificates
- Certificate details
	- Serial number
	- Version
	- Signature Algorithm
	- Issuer
	- Name of the cert holder
	- Public key
	- Extensions
	- etc

- #### Root of trust
	- Everything associated with IT security requires trust
	- An inherently trusted component
	- Hardware, software, firmware or other
	- Hardware security module (HSM), Secure Enclave, Certificate Authority etc

- #### Certificate signing requests
	- Create a key pair, then send the public key to the CA to be signed
		- A certificate signing request (CSR)
	- The CA validates the request
		- Confirms DNS emails and website ownership
	- CA digitally signs the cert
		- Returns to the applicant

- #### Self-signed certificates
	- Internal certificates don't need to be signed by a public CA
		- Your company is the only one using it
		- No need to purchase trust
	- Build your own CA
		- Issue your own certificates signed by yourself
	- Install the CA certificate/trusted chain on all devices
		- Works exactly like a certificate you purchased


- #### Wildcard certificates
	- Subject Alternative Name (SAN)
		- Extension to an X.509 certificate
		- Lists additional info
		- Allow a cert to support many different domains
			- ==example.com and test.net==
			- it DOES NOT automatically cover new subdomains as a wildcard does
			- it can hold from 250 to 1000 different names
	- Wildcard domain
		- Certificates are based on the name of the server
		- A wildcard domain will apply to all (and only) server names in a domain
			- ==\*\*.example.com BUT NOT anything related to test.net==
			- it DOES NOT automatically cover different domain names as a SAN does
			- it can cover infinite subdomains using the same primary name
	- Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
		- Maintained by the certificate authority
		- Can contain many revocations in a large file
	- Many different reasons
		- Changes all the time
	- CVE-2014-0160 -> HEARTBLEED
		- OpenSSL flaw put the private key of affected web services at risk
		- OpenSSL was patched, every web server certificate was replaced
		- Older certificates were moved to the CRL (revoked)

- #### OCSP stapling
	- Online Certificate Status Protocol
		- Provides scalability for OCSP checks
	- The CA is responsible for responding to all client OCSP requests
		- This scales poorly
	- Instead, have the certificate holder verify their own status
		- Status info is stored on the cert holder's server
	- OSCP status is "stapled" into the SSL/TLS handshake
		- Digitally signed by the CA
	- All web browsers have OCSP and can check for revocation
