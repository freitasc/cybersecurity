aka: Encrypting data at rest / data-at-rest
## What is it?

- Protect data on storage devices
	- SSD, HD, USB, cloud etc
- Full-disk and partition / volume encrypition
	- BitLocker, FileVault, etc.
- File encryption
	- EFS (Encrypting File System) comes with linux
## Additional Information

- #### Database Encryption
	- Protecting stored data and the transmission of that data
	- Transparent encryption
		- Encrypt all database info with a symmetric key
	- Record-level encryption
		- Encrypt individual columns
		- User separate symmetric keys for each collumn

But... Encrypting everything creates a enormous overhead, since every time I need to search the database, I need to decrypt it entirely...

The solution: Encrypting only the most crucial info, like SSN (social security number)

- #### Transport Encryption
	- Protect data traversing the network
		- You're probably doing this now
	- Encrypting in the application
		- Browsers can communicate using HTTPS
	- VPN (Virtual Private Network)
		- Encrypts all data transmitted over the network, regardless of the application, creating an encrypted tunnel
		- Client-based VPN using SSL/TLS
		- Site-to-site VPN using IPSEC
