## What is it?

- Hash
	- Represent data as a short string of text
	- One-way trip
		- Impossible to recover the original message form the digest
		- Used to store confidential info
	- ==INTEGRITY==
	- Can be a digital signature
		- Authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity
	- Functions
		- Take an input of any size
		- Create a fixed size string
		- Message digest, checksum
## Additional Information

- #### Collision
	- Every hash should be unique
		- Different inputs should create wildly different hashes
		- If they end-up the same, it's a collision
	- MD5 has a collision problem
		- Found in 1995
		- Don't use MD5 for anything important (actually never use it, its shit)

- #### Practical Hashing
	- Verify a downloaded file
		- Hashes may be provided on the download site
		- Compare the downloaded file hash with the posted hash value
	- Password storage
		- Instead of storing a raw password on a database, store a salted hash
		- Compare hashes during the authentication process
		- Nobody (not even the admin!) needs to ever know the actual password
	- Salt
		- Random data added to a password when hashing
		- Every user gets their own random salt
		- Rainbow table attacks won't work with salted hashes
		- This slows things down the brute force

- #### Digital Signature
	- Prove the message was not changed:  ==INTEGRITY==
	- Make sure the signature isn't fake: ==NON-REPUDIATION==
	- Sign with the private key
		- The message doesn't need to be encrypted
		- Nobody else can sign this without the private key
	- Verify with the public key
		- Any change in the message will invalidate the signature
