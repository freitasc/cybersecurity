## What is it?

- Policies, procedures, hardware, software, people
	- Digital certificates: create, distribute, manage, store, revoke
- This is a big, big endeavor
	- Lots of planning
- Also refers to the binding of public keys to people or devices
	- The certificate Authority
	- It's all about trust

## Additional Information

- #### Symmetric Encryption
	- A single, shared key
	- Encrypt, with the key
	- Decrypt with the same key
	- If it gets out, you'll need another key
- Secret Key Algorithm
	- A shared secret
- Doesn't scale very well
	- Can be challenging to distribute
- Very fast to use
	- Less overhead that asymmetric encryption
	- Often combined with asymmetric encryption

- #### Asymmetric encryption
	- Public key cryptography
		- Two (or more) mathematically related keys
	- Private Key
		- Keep this private
		- ==THE PRIVATE KEY IS THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN DECRYPT DATA ENCRYPTED WITH THE PUBLIC KEY==
		- You can't derive the private key from the public key
	- Public key
		- Anyone can see this key, Give it away
		- ==THE PUBLIC KEY CAN ENCRYPT DATA THAT CAN ONLY BE DECRYPTED WITH THE PRIVATE KEY==
		- You can't derive the public key from the private key
	- The key pair
		- Asymmetric encryption
			- Public Key cryptography
		- Key generation
			- Builds both the public and the private key at the same time using a lot of math
			- Lots of randomization
			- Large prime numbers
		- Everyone can have the public key, only you can have the private key.

- #### The key lengths
	- Larger keys tend to be more secure
		- Prevent or deter brute-force attacks
		- Attackers can try every possible key combination
	- Symmetric encryption
		- 128-bit or larger symmetric keys are common
		- These numbers get larger and larger as time goes on
	- Asymmetric encryption
		- Complex calculations of prime numbers
		- Larger keys than symmetric encryption
		- Common to see key lengths of 3072 bits or larger
	- Key stretching is possible
		- Make a weak key stronger by performing multiple processes of encrypting
		- Hashing a password, hash the hash of the password...
		- Key stretching = key strengthening
