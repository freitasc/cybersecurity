## What is it?

- Cryptography hardware on a device
	- Cryptographic processor
	- Random number generator
	- Key generator
	- Persistent memory
	- Unique keys burned in during manufacturing
	- Versatile memory
- Storage keys, hardware configuration information
	- Securely store BitLocker or any other vault keys
	- Password protected
	- No dictionary attacks

## Additional Information

- #### Hardware Security Module (HSM)
	- Used in large environments
		- Servers, Clusters, redundant power
		- Securely store thousands of cryptographic keys
	- High-end cryptographic hardware
		- Plug-in card or separate hardware device from the server
	- Key backup
		- Secure storage in hardware
	- Cryptographic accelerators
		- Offload that CPU overhead from other devices

- #### Key management system
	- Manage all keys from a centralized manager
		- Often provided as third-party software
		- Separate the encryption keys from the data
	- All key management from one console
		- Create keys for a specific service or cloud provider (SSL/TLS, SSH, etc)
		- Associate keys with specific users
		- Rotate keys on regular intervals automatically
		- Log key use and important events

- #### Secure enclave
	- A protected area for our secrets
		- Often implemented as hardware processor
		- Isolated from the main processor
		- Many different names for different providers
	- Provides extensive security features
		- Has its own boot ROM
		- Monitors the system boot process
		- True random number generator
		- Real-time memory encryption
		- Root cryptographic keys
		- Performs AES encryption in hardware
