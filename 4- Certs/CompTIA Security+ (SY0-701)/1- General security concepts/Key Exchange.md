## What is it?

- How do you share an encryption key across an insecure medium without physically transferring the key?

## Additional Information

- Real-time encryption/decryption
	- There's a need for fast security, without compromising the security part
	- Share a symmetric session key using asymmetric encryption
		- Client encrypts a random (symmetric) key with a server's public key (asymmetric)
		- The server decrypts this share key using its private key (asymmetric)
		- The server uses this new found (symmetric) key to encrypt data
		- #### ==THIS ORIGINAL (symmetric) KEY GENERATED BY THE CLIENT IS NOW THE SESSION KEY==
		- This key can easily be discarded and the process redone without much overhead
			- The keys need to be changed often (ephemeral)
			- The process needs to be unpredictable
		- This is the bases of credentials/logins in webapps


-  Symmetric key from asymmetric keys
	- Use public and private key cryptography to create a symmetric key
	- This way both sides will end up with the same symmetric key even tho they didn't exchange them
	- Math is powerful
