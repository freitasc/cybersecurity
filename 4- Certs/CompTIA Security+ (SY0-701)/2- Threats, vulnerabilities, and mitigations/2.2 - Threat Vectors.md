## What is it?

- A method used by the attacker
	- Also called =="Attack Vectors"==

- A lot of work must be done to find this vectors
	- Some are more vulnerable and valuable than others

- IT security professional spend their career watching these vectors
	- Protect existing vectors
	- Find new vectors
## Additional Information

- Message-based vectors
	- One of the biggest threat vectors
		- Phishing
		- Social-Engineering
		- No-click based on a zero-day vulnerability
		- Injection
		- Malware download link
	- Email
	- SMS
	- Social Media
	- Direct Messages

- Image-based vectors
	- Harder to identify as a threat
	- Not all, but some image formats can be threats
		- ==SVGs are described in XML== and can there for be ==injected with javacript== malware
		- PNG and JPGs

- File-based vectors
	- More than just executables
		- ==PDFs can be embedded with malware== that will run when the user opens the document
		- ==ZIP/RAR files can be made into "zipbombs"==, logical bombs that detonate and run when a user decompresses the file
		- ==Docx== (microsoft office) ==documents can have macros attached==, this macros could run and execute other scripts that can initiate an attack

- Voice call vectors
	- Vishing
	- Spam over IP
	- War dialing
	- Call tampering (DDOS in call format)

- Removable devices vectors
	- Infected USBs and HDs are the most common
	- The only way to get inside a air gaped network
		- Used constantly against industrial systems (SCADA for example) not connected to the internet
	- Keyboards, Monitors, TVs... Even cellphone chargers can act as vectors

- Vulnerable software vectors
	- Client-based
		- Infected executable run by the machine
		- Known or unknown (zero day) vulnerabilities
		- That's why you need to constant update your machine
	- Agentless
		- No installed executable
		- A software already running in the machine is now compromised
		- Client runs a new instance each time is booted
		- Very famously the registry table based attack on windows

- Unsupported system vectors
	- Patching is an important prevention tool
	- Unsupported systems aren't patched
	- Outdated OS
	- A single system could be an entry
	- Keep inventory, keep an eye on it and PLEASE eventually get rid of them

- Unsecure network vectors
	- Wireless
		- WEP, WPA and WPA2 are vulnerable, please change to WPA3
		- Open or rogue wireless networks
		- Pìneapple router attacks
	- Wired
		- Unsecure interfaces -> turn 802.1X on please
	- Bluetooth is usually very insecure
		- Very useful for recon

- Open service ports
	- Most network-based services connect over a TCP or UDP port
	- Every port is an opportunity
	- Firewall rules must be setup
	- Nmap can map all the open ports

- Default credentials
	- Most devices have default usernames and passwords
	- Home wifi routers are usually like this

- Supply chain vector
	- Tamper with the underlying infrastructure or manufacturing process of technology used by the organization
	- Managed service providers (MSPs)
	- Gain access to a network using a vendor or partner
	- Suppliers
		- Counterfeit neworking equipment
		- Install backdoors, substandard performance and availability
