## What is it?

- Not every update is equally secure
- Some updates can come from untrusted sources
- Some updates can add vulnerabilities instead of removing then
- A attacker can add malicious code in an update
- A fake browser pop-up asking for update, for example
- Many OS will only allow digitally signed updates or apps
- Automatic updates are usually more trustworthy than manual ones
	- but... it can be vulnerable to water holing attacks and supply chain attacks
