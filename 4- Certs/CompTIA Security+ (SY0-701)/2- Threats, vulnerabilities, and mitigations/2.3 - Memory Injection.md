## What is it?

- Malware runs in memory
- Memory contains running processes
	- DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries)
	- Threads
	- Buffers
	- Kernel things
	- Much much more
- Malware is hidden somewhere
	- Malware runs in its own process
	- Malware then injects itself into a legitimate process
		- Terraform
		- Kubernetes
		- Docker
		- etc
## Additional Information

- Add code into the memory of an existing process
	- Hide malware inside the process
	- Get access to the data in that process
	- Get the same privileges and permissions of that process
	- PRIVILEGE ESCALATION IS THE KEY!

- Dynamic-Link Library
	- A windows library containing code and data
	- Many applications can use this library
	- Attackers inject a path to a malicious DLL
		- Runs as part of the target process
		- Almost invisible if done right
		- One of the most popular memory injection methods
		- Relatively easy to pull off
