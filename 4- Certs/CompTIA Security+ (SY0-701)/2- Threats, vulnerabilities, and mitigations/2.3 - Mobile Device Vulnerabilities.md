## What is it?

- Mobile devices are challenging to secure, are always in motion and have sensitive data
- They are constantly connected to the internet by using 3/4/5g
- They are very good vectors for an attack
- You don't have access to the OSs configurations like you do on a computer

## Additional Information

- Jailbreaking / Rooting
	- Android are linux-based, so it is called ROOTING
	- IOS are not linux-based, so it is called JAILBREAKING
	- This replaces the firmware with a custom firmware that lets the attacker take hold of everything
		- This way all the security imposed on the phone (by the manufacture or third-party) can be circumvented and even appear as legit
- Sideloading
	- Malicious apps exist
	- The manufacture often alerts or even blocks attempts on installing software that doesn't come from their download platform
		- The reason for this is that malicious apps can be downloaded from suspicious sources
