## What is it?

- Virtual Machines (VM) are software that runs like a operating system of a machine
- VMs are machines withing machines
- They are quite different from normal OSs
- Complexity adds opportunities for attackers
## Additional Information

- Hypervisor
	- It is a machine designed for running multiple VMs
	- Proxmox is a famous example
	- It has great resource elasticity, making it ideal for running multiple VMs
	- Data can be shared between VMs since they are "competing" for the same RAM
		- This gives great opportunity for attackers to make a lateral movement between VMs
- Virtual Machine Escape (VM Escape)
	- Breaking out of the VM space into the main machine that runs it
	- Can be made in different ways
	- It is a way to escalate privilage, as the main machine runs and administer not only the VM, but other software
	- It is a way of vertical movement
	- Can be used to get inside a network and starting exploring it
	- Gives you complete control of the VM being run
