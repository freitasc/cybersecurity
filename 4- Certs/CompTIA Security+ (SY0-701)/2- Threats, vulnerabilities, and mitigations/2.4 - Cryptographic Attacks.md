## What is it?

- Finding ways to undo the encryption
## Additional Information

- Collisions
	- In a classroom of 23 students, what is the chance of two students sharing a birthday
		- About 50%
		- For a class of 30, the chance is about 70%
		- In the digital world, this is called HASH COLLISION
			- A hash collision is the same hash value for different texts
			- Finding a collision through brute force can be very valuable
			- The attacker will generate multiple versions of text to match the hashes
			- MD5 Hash - Message Digest Algorithm 5
				- First published in April 1992
				- Abandoned because of collisions identified in 1996
- Downgrade attack
	- Forcing 2 systems trying to talk to each other to use a weaker version of encryption
	- SSL Stripping
			- Combines on-path attack with downgrade attack
			- Attacker sits in the middle of the conversation
			- Victims browser page isn't encrypted
			- Strips the S away from HTTPS
