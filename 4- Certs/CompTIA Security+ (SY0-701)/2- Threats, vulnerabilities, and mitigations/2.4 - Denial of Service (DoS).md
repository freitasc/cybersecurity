## What is it?

- Denying a service by the means of force
- Usually spamming a server until it crashes or is unable to serve its function to an actual user
## Additional Information

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
	- Same, but with more and more computers
	- Can be made from a single computer running multiple scripts or VMs
	- It is usually made by a botnet
	- Attackers that have a botnet under their belt sell DDoS services to criminals, companies and nation states
	- Attackers also can buy a cloud infrastructure of various machines to do DDoS
	- It is simply a matter of investment vs benefit, no one is DDoSing a website for nothing as this costs money (electricity, computing power)
	- It is, by definition, asymmetric 
- Reflection and Amplification
	- If you can find a device that can reflect the connections, you can essentially duplicate the potency of the attack
		- IoT and other devices are commonly attack vectors for this
		- For example, known devices on the same network as the server and that can ping the server, so they would both ping the server and ping the device, the device would then ping the server, duplicating their power of DDoS
	- They can use protocols with little to no auth to amplify
		- NTP, DNS, ICMP
		- For example, an attacker uses DNS resolvers to send data into the target server, the original message for the DNS resolver was relatively small, but know it gains a bigger Body message, the resolver would then move the request onto the server, amplifying the attack by adding more data.
