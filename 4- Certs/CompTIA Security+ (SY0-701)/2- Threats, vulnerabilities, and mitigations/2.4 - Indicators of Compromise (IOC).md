- Confidence is high
## Additional Information

- Indicators are tips
	- Unusual amount of network activity
	- Change to file hash values
	- Change to registry tables
	- Irregular international traffic (US, Russia, China, random Caribbean islands)
	- Changes to DNS data
	- Uncommon login patterns (brute force attempts)
	- Spikes of read requests to certain files
	- Account lockout
		- Credentials not working
		- Exceeded logins attempts (wasn't you)
		- Admin disabled it
		- Attacker gets the account lock and then calls the support line to reset the password by himself
	- Concurrent session usage
		- Multiple accounts logins from multiple locations
		- Being logged in from both a USA gateway and a Chinese gateway
		- Multiple devices and desktops
		- It is almost definitely automated
	- Blocked content
		- Your system has been breached, and now the attacker doesn't want you snooping around
		- Keeps you out of critical files, doesn't let you update, your browser can't search for solutions
		- That probably means there is already a way to patch it
	- Impossible travel
		- Login in Brazil, 10 minutes later a login from Europe
		- Easy to identify and even automate
		- Can be easily analysed using a SIEM or similar
	- Resource consumption
		- Attacker using a lot of processing power at 3AM
		- Attacker using a lot of bandwidth on low work hours
		- Bitcoin farm? Bot net? Advertising? who knows
	- Resource inaccessibility
		- Attacker is crashing the services by trying to brute force it
		- Disruption might be a cover for the actual exploit
		- Or it might be a result of an already done ransomware, only waiting for the victim to notice it
	- Out-of-cycle logging
		- Update log outside of the normal time for updates
		- Firewall changes outside of normal parameters
		- Can be easily analysed using SIEM or similar
	- Missing logs
