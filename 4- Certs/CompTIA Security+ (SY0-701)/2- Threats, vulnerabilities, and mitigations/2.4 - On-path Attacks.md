- Redirects your traffic
- It is effectively invisible to the victim's device

## Additional Information

- ARP poisoning
	- On-path attack on the local IP subnet
	- ARP has not security or encryption
- Port Mirroring
	- An attacker's device or himself has access to the switch
	- He can then "mirror" or "clone" all the packets that traverse through that switch
	- It is a malicious use of SPAN (Switched Port Analyzer)
	- It is difficult to detect because it is a passive
	- It can be used to mirror traffic from individual ports, entire VLANs, or even across switches (Remote SPAN/RSPAN).
- On-patch browser attack
	- Malware/Trojan does all of the proxy work
	- Formerly known as main-in-the-browser
