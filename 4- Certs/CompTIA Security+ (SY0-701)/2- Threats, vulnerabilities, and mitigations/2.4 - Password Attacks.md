## What is it?

- Plaintext / unencrypted passwords are easy
- Do not store passwords as plaintext ever
## Additional Information

- Spraying attack
	- A type of brute force, but with finesse and low-cost
	- Try to login with an incorrect password
	- Eventually the account will be locked
	- Attack an account with the top three (or more a little) most common passwords
		- If it locks you out, move to the next account
		- Eventually it is statistically likely you will find an account with weak and common password being used
		- ==It is about testing various accounts a low amount of times==
- Credential stuffing
	- You can easily get a list of 1 billion most common passwords on the internet
	- On the dark web, you can even get passwords from a database leak
	- You can then test ALL this known passwords until you get in
		- It is different from spraying because spraying is about trying different accounts a little
		- ==Credential stuffing is testing a very high amount of passwords into 1 account==
- Brute force
	- Try every possible password combination until the hash is matched
	- Will get the account locked and even your IP banned
	- Can also end up being a DDoS depending on how quicker and strong you make the attack
