## What is it?

- Useful information is transmitted over the network
- Need access to raw network data
	- Network tap
		- So you can monitor the raw network data
	- ARP poisoning
		- So the victim sends the data to you
	- Infect the victim with malware
		- So you can spy on those data yourself
- After you got the info, you can then REPLAY the requests to a server, posing as the victim
- This IS NOT an on-path attack
	- The actual replay doesn't require the original workstation
	- Also doesn't require for you to be "in the middle" of a connection in the moment of the replay

## Additional Information

- Pass the hash
	- A user passes a request to a server
	- A attacker then captures the auth hash
		- Can be by means of on-path (or not)
	- The attacker then reuses that auth hash to send a different request to the server
	- He can effectively pose as the original user
	- This can be avoided by using a salt or encryption (server-side solution)
		- Use a session ID with the password hash to create a unique auth hash each time
- Browser cookies are valuable
	- Used for tracking, personalization, session management
	- It is a privacy risk
	- Session IDs are often stored in cookies, to maintain sessions across multiple browser sessions
		- This session IDs can be used in a replay attack to pass yourself as the victim
		- Attacker can manipulate the HEADER (where the session ID is usually sent
