## What is it?

- Attacks that target wireless networks
- You may not be able to stop it
- There are little things you can do about an attacker set on ruining that wireless net
## Additional Information

- 802.11 wireless includes a number of management features
	- They are frames that makes everything work
	- You never see them
	- This frames are important for the operation of 802.11
		- How to find access points, manage QoS, associate/disassociate with an access point etc
		- The original wireless standards did not add protection for this management frames
			- They were sent in the clear, no auth or validation
			- This can be easily exploited with aircrack-ng on old wireless nets
			- The packages can be read using wireshark
- IEEE updated to 802.11ac
	- Disassociate, deauthenticate, channel switch and other are now encrypted
	- NOT EVERYTHING IS ENCRYPTED
		- Beacons, probes, authentication, association are still on the clear
- Radio frequency (RF) Jamming
	- Denial of Service (DoS)
		- Transmit interfering wireless signals that decreases the signal-to-noise at the receiving device
		- The receiving device then cant connect to the network by not getting good signal
	- Sometimes It's not even intentional
		- Interference happens, jamming is always malicious
		- Cellphones interfere with car radio
		- Air crew telling you to put you phone on plane mode before a flight
	- For it to work, you need to be physically close to the affected devices
