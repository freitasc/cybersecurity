- Hybrid considerations
	- Hybrid cloud is when there is more than one public or private cloud
	- More complex
	- Network protection mismatches
		- Auth across platforms
		- firewall configs
		- Server settings
	- Different security monitoring
		- Combining logs may be hard
	- Data Leakage
		- Data is shared across public networks
- Third-party vendors in the cloud are a risk
	- You, the cloud provider, and third parties should work together
	- Ongoing vendor risk assessments
	- Include third-party impact for incident response
	- Constant monitoring
- Infrastructure as code -> Terraform
	- Decribe an infrastructure
		- Define servers, network and app as code
		- Modify the infra and create versions
		- Use the descrition to build other app instances
		- An important concept for cloud
- Serverless Architecture
	- Function as a Service (FaaS)
	- App are separated into individual, autonomous functions
	- Remove the operating system from the equation
	- Developer still creates the server-side logic
	- May be event triggered and ephemeral
	- Managed by a third-party
- Microservices and APIs
	- API = Application Programming Interfaces
	- API is the "glue" for the microservices
		- Work together to act as the app
	- Scalable
		- Just scale more microservices as you need
	- Resilient
		- Outages are contained
	- Security and compliance
		- Containment is build-in
