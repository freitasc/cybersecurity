## What is it?

- Varied means of making the security of a system better

## Additional Information

- Updates
	- OS updates
	- Service packs
	- Security patches
- User Accounts
	- Minimum length and complexity of password
	- Account limitations
- Network
	- Limit network access
	- Segmentation
- Monitor and secure
	- AV, EDR, XDR
- Encryption
	- App encryption
	- Full disk encryption
	- All network comunication
		- VPN
- Endpoint
	- User's machine
	- Many different platforms
		- Mobile vs Desktop
	- Protection is multi-faceted
- EDR/XDR (Endpoint detection and response)
	- Detect a threat
	- React to a threat
		- Isolate the system, quarantine the threat, rollback the system
		- API driven, no user or technician needed (usually integrated into a SIEM)
	- Redirect and generate logs to a central point (SIEM)
		- SIEM can then represent it in a graphical format
	- Checking for signature shouldn't be the only detection tool (or not... checkout Wazuh)
	- Make behavioral analysis, machine learning, process monitoring
	- Lightweight (or not... checkout Crowdstrike)
	- Investicate the threat
		- Root cause analysis
- Host-based firewall
	- Software-based firewall
	- Allow or disallow incoming or outgoing app traffic
	- Indenfity ands block unknown process
		- Logs could be valuable
	- Can be managed remotely
- Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)
	- Recognize and block known attacks
	- Secure OS and app configs
	- Often built into EDR
	- HIPS identification
		- Signature, heuristics, behavioral
		- Buffer overflows, registry updates, writing files to a OS folder
		- Access to non-encrypted data
- Open ports and services
	- Every port is a possible entry point
	- Control access with firewall
		- NGFW is better
	- Unused or unknown services
		- Opened by the OS or some app
	- App with broad port ranges are a risk
	- Use NMAP to scan for opened ports
- Default password
	- Almost every device has a management interface
	- Every device comes with a default password that is unsafe
	- Change the password!!!!
	- Sometimes you can even put on MFA
- Removal of unnecessary software
	- All software contains bugs, and some bugs are vulnerabilities
	- Remove all unused software
