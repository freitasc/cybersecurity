## What is it?

- What to keep in mind while thinking about designing an Infrastructure
## Additional Information

- Availability
	- System uptime
	- Balancing act with security
	- We spend a lot of time and money on availability, as it is how a company usually generates more money
- Resilience
	- Can you maintain availability? Can you recover? How quickly?
	- Based on many variables
	- Commonly references as MTTR
		- Mean Time to Repair
- Cost
	- How much money is required?
	- Difficult to calculate
	- Ongoing maintenance has a cost as well
	- Replacement or repair costs
	- Tax implications
- Responsiveness
	- How quickly did that happen?
	- Especially important for interactive apps
	- Speed is an important metric
- Scalability
	- How quickly and easily can we increase or decrease capacity?
	- AKA Elasticity
	- There's always a resource challenge
	- Microservices, loadbalancers
	- Needs to include security monitoring as it scales
- Ease of deployment
	- An app has many moving parts
		- Web servers, databases, caching servers, firewall etc
	- This might be an involved process
		- Hardware resources, cloud budgets, change control
	- This might be very simple
		- Orchestration / automation
	- Important to consider during the product engineering phase
		- One missed detail can cause deployment errors or risks
- Risk transference
	- Many methods to minimize risk
		- Transfer the risk to a third-party
	- Cybersecurity insurance
		- Attacks and downtime can be covered
		- Popular with the rise of ransomware
			- A lot of insurances describe how much of a ransom then third party will pay
	- Recover internal losses
		- Outages and business downtime means lost money
	- Protect against legal issues from customers
		- Limit the costs associated with legal process
- Ease of recovery
	- Something will eventually go wrong
	- How easily can you recover?
	- Example: Malware infection
		- Reload OS from safe state = 1 hour
		- Reload from corporate image = 10 minutes
	- This may be critical to the final product
- Patch availability
	- Software isn't usually static
	- This is often the first task after installation
	- Most companies have regular updates
	- Some companies rarely patch
	- Inability to patch
		- Embedded systems
		- Legacy systems
		- Banking systems
- Power
	- This require extensive engineering
	- Overall power requirements
		- Data center vs office building
	- Primary power
		- One or more providers
	- Backup services
		- UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
		- Generators
- Compute
	- An app's heavy lifter
	- More than just a single CPU
	- May be limited to a single processor
		- Easier to develop
		- Hard to scale
	- Use multiple CPUs across multiple clouds
		- Additional complexity
		- Enhanced scalability
