## What is it?

- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
	- Watch network traffic
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
	- Alarm or alert
	- Stop it before it gets into the network
- Intrusions
	- Exploits agains OSs, apps etc
	- Buffer overflows, XSS and other vulnerabilities

## Additional Information

- Failure modes
	- We hope for 100% uptime
		- That is obviously impossible
		- Eventually, something breaks
	- Fail-open
		- When a system fails or is breached, data continues to flow
		- That poses serious security and integrity risks, but at least it will continue running
	- Fail-closed
		- When a system fails or is breached, data does not flow
		- That creates good security, but will stop everything, creating losses for the company
- Device connections
	- Active monitoring
		- System is connected inline
		- Data can be blocked in real-time as it passes by
		- Intrusion prevention is commonly active

		- IDS/IPS sits physically inline
			- All traffic passes through it
		- Malicious traffic is immediately identified
			- Dropped at the IPS
			- Does not proceed through the network
	- Passive monitoring
		- A copy of the network traffic is examined using a tap or port monitor
		- Data cannot be blocked in real-time
		- Intrusion detection is commonly passive
		- ![[Pasted image 20260203183236.png]]
		- Examine a copy of the traffic
			- Port mirror
			- SPAN (Switch Port Analyzer)
			- Network Tap
		- Not way to block (prevent) traffic
			- Common with IDS (with no IPS)
