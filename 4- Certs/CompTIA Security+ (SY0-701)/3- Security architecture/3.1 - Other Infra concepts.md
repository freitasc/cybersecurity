## What is it?

- On-premise vs cloud-based, what is more secure?
- Cloud based security costs less!
	- no dedicated hardware, no data center
	- third-party handles everything
	- but... harder to handle specifics of your business and you inherit the vulnerabilities of the third party vendor
- On-premises puts the security burden on the client
	- more autonomy, more freedom of choice, more secure and no interference 
	- but... data center security and infrastructure costs are now yours, and you will have to have a dedicated team for it
- Attackers don't care, its all the same for them
## Additional Information

- On premises security
	- Customize you security posture
	- On-site IT team can manage security better
	- Local team maintains uptime and avaibility
	- Security changes can take more and more time
- Centralized vs Decentralized
	- Most organizations are physically decentralized
		- Many locations, cloud providers, OSs etc
	- Difficult to manage and protect so many different systems
	- A centralized approach
		- Correlated alerts (SIEM + Machine Learning)
		- Consolidated log file analysis (SIEM + Behavioral)
		- Comprehensive system status and maintenance/patching (SIEM + EDR)
		- ITS NOT PERFECT -> Single point of failure
			- If the attackers take down your centralized point, they get everything



- Virtualization
	- Running many different OSs on the same hardware
	- Proxmox or other hypervisor
	- Each app instance has its own OS
		- Adds overhead and complexity
		- It is somewhat expensive
		- But creates isolation and better security
- Containerization
	- Contains everything you need to run the app, one OS runs everything
		- Self-contained, apps can't interact with each other
		- But not total isolation, as they run in the same OS
		- Less expensive then full virtualization
		- Less secure then full virtualization
	- Docker and Kube, or other container
	- Code as dependencies
	- A standardized unit of software

- Internet of Things (IoT)
	- Sensors, smart devices, wearable tech, facility automation
	- Weak defaults
		- IoT manufacturers don't care about security
		- Easy single points of failure
	- SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition system)
		- Large-scale, multi-site Industrial Control Systems (ICS)
		- PC manages equipment
			- Power generation, refining, manufacturing
			- Facilities, industrial, electrical grids, energy, logistics etc
			- Distributed control system
				- Real-time info
				- System control
			- Requires extensive segmentation
				- NO ACCESS FROM OUTSIDE
	- RTOS (Real-Time Operation system)
		- An operation system with a deterministic processing schedule
			- No time to wait for other processes
			- Industrial, cars, military equipment
		- Extremely sensitive to security issues
			- Non-trivial syustems
			- Need to always be available
			- Difficult to know what type of security is in place
	- Embedded Systems
		- Hardware and software designed for a specific function
		- Is built with only one task in mind
		- Common examples: Traffic lights, medical imaging systems
	- High availability
		- HA (High Availability) vs LA (Low Availability)
		- Redundancy doesn't always means available
		- HA may include many different components working together
		- Higher availability almost always means higher costs
