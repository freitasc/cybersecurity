## What is it?

- The universal security control
	- Home, office, and in your OS
	- Control the flow of network traffic
	- Corporate control of outbound and inbound data
	- Control of inappropriate control
		- Parental control or employer control
	- Protection from evil
		- Anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-worm, you name it
## Additional Information

- Network-based firewalls
	- Filter traffic by port number of application
	- OSI layer 4 -> transport layer (TCP and UDP)
	- NGFW firwalls can filter on OSI layer 7 -> application layer
	- Encrypt traffic
	- Most firewals can be OSI layer 3 devices (network layer, routers, physical path)
		- Often sits on the ingress/egress of the network
		- Network Address Translation (NAT) functionality
		- Authenticate dynamic routing communication
- UTM / All-in-one security appliance
	- Unified Threat Management (UTM)
	- URL filter / Content inspection
	- Malware inspection
	- Spam filter
	- CSU / DSU
		- Channel Service Unit / Data Service Unit
		- A router
		- The CSU is responsible for the connection to the telecommunication network 
		- The DSU is responsible for managing the interface with the user
	- Router, Switch
	- Firewall
	- IDS / IPS
	- Bandwidth shaper
	- VPN endpoint
	- Even though it is a swiss knife, it comes with drawbacks
		- It can only look at OSI layer 4 (transport, TCP and UDP)
		- Crushes performance
- Next-generation firewall (NGFW)
	- Checks not only OSI layer 4 (transport, TCP and UDP)
	- But also checks for OSI layer 7 (application layer)
		- Reads all data in every packet using its context
		- It knows why and how a certain "league of legends" packet is traversing the net
		- Maybe it allows you to see twitter, but not post it
		- Maybe you can post on youtube, but not watch it
		- Even tho LoL, twitter and youtube all use the same port numbers, it knows by context what is what and what rules to apply to each packet
	- Can be called different names
		- Application layer gateway
		- Stateful multilayer inspection
		- Deep packet inspectiojn
	- Requires some advanced decodes
		- Every packet must be analyzed and categorized before a security decisions is made
	- Very commonly it has a IPS bult in
		- Can identify the app and apply application-specific vulnerability signature reads to the traffic
	- Content filtering
		- URL filters
		- Control website traffic by category
- Web application firewall (WAF)
	- Not like a "normal" firewall
		- Applies rules to HTTP/HTTPS conversations
	- Allow or deny based on expected input
		- Unexpected input is a common method is exploiting an application (injection)
	- A major focus of Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
