## What is it?

- Network devices that serves as utility (security or otherwise)
## Additional Information

- Jump Server
	- A server that provides an access mechanism to a protected network
	- Bastion, from AWS
	- It is a highly secured device, hardened and monitored
	- SSH / Tunnel / VPN to the jump server
	- RDP, SSH, or jump from there
	- If the attacker compromise the jump server it is A SIGNIFICANT BREACH!!!!

- Proxies
	- Sits between the user and external network
	- Receives the user requests and sends the request on their behalf
	- Useful for catching information, access control, URL filtering, content scanning
	- Very useful for attackers trying to obfuscate their origin
	- Apps may need to know how to use the proxy (explicit)
	- Some proxies are invisible (transparent)
- Application Proxies
	- One of the simplest "proxies" is NAT
		- A network-level proxy
	- Most proxies in use are application proxies
		- The proxy understands the way the app works
	- A proxy may only know one application
		- HTTP
	- Many proxies are multipurpose proxies
		- HTTP, HTTPS, FTP etc
	- Forward proxy
		- An "internal proxy"
		- Commonly used to protect and control user access to the internet
		- ![[Pasted image 20260203184429.png]]
	- Reverse proxy
		- Inbound traffic from the internet to your internal service
		- Adds security by creating another layer between the servers and the internet
			- Malicious traffic can be dropped at the proxy
			- Can serve as a caching server, dropping duplicate requests from user or resending a answer from the server that was previously cached
		- ![[Pasted image 20260203184525.png]]
	- Open proxy
		- A third-party, uncontrolled proxy
			- Can be a significant security concern
			- Often used to circumvent existing security controls
			- By chaining multiple proxy together, one can easily obfuscate their origin
			- Proxychains comes with Kali ;)
			- If you are a attacker, you shouldn't trust every proxy provider as they WILL give the logs to the feds if you get them involved in a crime
			- If you are a defender, you shouldn't trust every proxy provider as they can monitor your activities or even have malicious code that will get added to your requests, posing a serious security risk

	- Load Balancer
		- Distribute the load through multiple servers
		- Invisible to the user
		- Can be user in large-scale
			- Web server farms, database farms
			- Microservices
		- Fault tolerance
			- Server outages have no effect
			- Very fast convergence
		- Configurable load
		- TCP offload
		- SSL offload
		- Caching for faster response
		- Content Switching
		- Active/Active
			- All the servers connected to the load balancer are ready to be used
			- The load balancer then auto prioritize based on metrics
		- Active/Passive
			- Not all the servers connected to the load balancer are ready to be used
			- Some servers are "standby" servers
			- If an active server fails, the load balancer then switches the traffic to a passive server, making it active and the former active into "no longer available"
	- Sensors and Collectors
		- Aggregate info from network devices
			- Bult-in sensors, separate devices
			- Integrated into switches, routers, servers, firewalls etc
		- Sensors
			- IPS, firewall logs, auth logs, web server access logs, database transaction logs, email logs
		- Collectors
			- Proprietary consoles (IPS, Firewall) can only see themselves
			- SIEM consoles and syslog servers can aggregate everything
			- All modern SIEMs include a correlation engine to compare diverse sensor data
