## What is it?

- Ways to securely connect to a secure network
- VPNs
## Additional Information

- SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer)
	- Uses common SSL/TLS protocol (tcp/443)
	- Authenticate users through a "handshake"
	- TLS is actually the newest and secure version of SSL, but people still call it SSL
	- ==Websites use TLS to secure all communications between their servers and web browsers==
	- ==It is a standard for webapps and secure web communication==
	- ==It uses asymmetric cryptography to establish communication and authentication==
	- ==Then uses symmetric cryptography to communicate the data in transit in a secure way==
- VPN (Virtual Private Network)
	- Encrypted data traversing a public network
	- Concentrator
		- Encryption/decryption access device
		- Often integrated into a firewall
	- Many deployment options
		- Specialized cryptographic hardware (usually for corporations)
		- Software-based options available (small business or common users)
	- Used with client software
		- Sometimes built into the OS

	- Encrypted Tunnel
		- Keep data private across the public internet
		- Encrypt your data
			- Add new headers and trailers
				- IPSec Headers and Trailers are added
				- So you can know where this encrypted data starts and ends

	- Site-to-site IPsec VPN
		- Always-on
		- Firewalls often act as VPN concentrators
		- ==IPsec is a bundle of protocols that makes most VPNs work==
		- ==It is a Layer 3 (network) thing, it is never about web communication==
	- SD-WAN (Software Defined Networking in a Wide Area Network)
		- ==A WAN built for the cloud==
		- The data center used to be in one place, but cloud changed everything
		- Cloud-based apps communicate directly to the cloud through SD-WAN

	- Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)
		- ==A "next generation" of VPNs==
		- Update secure access for cloud services
		- It has built into it various of the technologies previously discussed
			- SD-WANs
			- IPSec VPNs
			- Zero-Trust
			- SSL/TLS
			- and others
		- Security technologies are in the cloud
			- Located close to existing cloud services
