## What is it?

- Every infra is different, every infra demands a different secure solution kit
## Additional Information

- Device placement
	- Every network is different
	- Firewalls
		- Separate trusted from untrusted
	- Other services may require their own secure tech
		- Honeypots
		- Jump Servers
		- Load Balancers
		- Sensors

- Security Zones
	- Zone-based security tech
		- More flexible and secure than IP range
	- Each area of the network is associated with a zone
		- Trusted, Untrusted
		- Internal, External
		- Inside, Internet, Servers, Databases, Screened
	- This simplifies security policies
		- Trusted to Untrusted, but not the opposite
		- Untrusted to Screened
		- More rarely, Untrusted to Trusted (CAUTION)

- Attack Surface
	- How many ways into your home?
		- Doors, windows, basements
	- Everything can be a vulnerability
		- Application code
		- Open ports
		- Auth process
		- Human error (social engineering)
	- Minimize the surface
		- Audit the code
		- Block ports on the firewall
		- Monitor traffic in real-time
		- Teach humans how to not get social engineered
	- Connectivity
		- Everything contributes to security
		- Secure network cabling
		- Application-level encryption
		- Network-level encryption
