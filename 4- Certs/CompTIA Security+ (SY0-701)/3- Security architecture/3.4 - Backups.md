## What is it?

- The ability to come back from death
## Additional Information

 - Many different implementations
	 - Total amount of data
	 - Type of backup
	 - Backup media
	 - Storage location
	 - Backup and recovery software
	 - Day of the week
 - On site
	 - No internet link required
	 - Data is immediately available
	 - Generally less expensive
 - Off site
	 - Transfer data over the internet or WAN link
	 - Data is available after a disaster
	 - Restoration can be performed from anywhere
 - Organizations often use both
	 - More copies of the data
	 - More options when restoring
 - Frequency
	 - How often to backup
	 - This may be different between systems
	 - May have multiple backup sets
	 - This requires planning
		 - Multiple backup set across different days
		 - Lots of media to manage
- Encryption
	- A history of data is on backup media
	- Back-ups makes it very easy for an attacker
		- All of the data is in one place
	- Protect backup data using encryption
	- Especially useful and almost obligatory when it is about cloud backups
- Snapshots
	- Became popular on VMs
	- An instant backup of an entire system
	- Save the current configs and data
	- Take another snapshot after 24hs
	- Take a snapshot everyday
- Recovery testing
	- It's not enough to perform the backup
		- You have to be able to restore from it
	- Disaster recovery testing simulates a disaster
	- Confirm the restoration
		- Test the restored app and data
	- Perform periodic audits
- Replication
	- An ongoing, almost real-time backup
		- Keep data synchronized in multiple locations
	- Data is available, there is always a copy somewhere else
	- Data can be stored locally to all users, replicated to all remote sites
	- Data is recoverable
- Journaling
	- Power goes out while writing data to storage
		- Stored data is probably corrupted
		- Recovery could be complicated
	- Before writing to storage, make a journal entry
		- After the journal is written, write the data to storage
