## What is it?

- Can you maintain availability? Can you recover? How quickly?
## Additional Information

- High availability (HA)
	- Always on, always available
- Server Clustering
	- Combine two or more servers
		- Appears and operates as a single large server
		- Users only see one device
	- Easy to increase capacity and availability
		- Just add more servers
	- Usually configures in the OS
		- All devices use the same OS
- Load Balancer
		- Distribute the load through multiple servers
		- Invisible to the user
		- Can be user in large-scale
			- Web server farms, database farms
			- Microservices
		- Fault tolerance
			- Server outages have no effect
			- Very fast convergence
		- Configurable load
		- TCP offload
		- SSL offload
		- Caching for faster response
		- Content Switching
		- Active/Active
			- All the servers connected to the load balancer are ready to be used
			- The load balancer then auto prioritize based on metrics
		- Active/Passive
			- Not all the servers connected to the load balancer are ready to be used
			- Some servers are "standby" servers
			- If an active server fails, the load balancer then switches the traffic to a passive server, making it active and the former active into "no longer available"
- Recovery site
	- Data is synchronized
	- A disaster is called
		- Business processes failover to the alternate processing site
	- Problem is addressed
		- This can take hours, weeks or longer
	- Revert bat to the primary location

	- Hot site
		- An exact replica of the original
		- Stocked with hardware
			- You buy 2 of everyhing
		- Applications and software are constantly updates
		- Flip a switch and everything moves
	- Cold site
		- No hardware
		- No data
		- No people
	- Warm site
		- Somewhere between cold and hot
			- Just enought to get going
		- Big room with rack space

	- Geographic dispersion
		- These sites should be physically different that the organization's primary location
		- Can be a logistical challenge
	- Platform diversity
		- Every operating system contains potential security issues
		- Many security vulnerabilities are specific to a single OS
		- Use many different platforms to spread the risk around
	- Multi-cloud Systems
		- Plan for cloud outages
			- Disperse the services between providers
			- Something is in AWS, something else in Azure, other in GC etc
		- Data is both geographically dispersed and the cloud service dispersed
			- A breach with one provider would not affect the others
			- Plan for every contingency
	- Continuity of operations planning (COOP)
		- Not everything goes according to plan
			- Disasters can cause a disruption to the norm
		- We rely on our computer systems
			- Technology is pervasive
		- There needs to be an alternative
			- Manual transactions
			- Paper receipts
			- Phone calls
		- These must be documented and tested before a crisis occurs
