## What is it?

- How to secure apps
## Additional Information

- Secure coding concepts
	- Testing, testing, testing
	- Get yourself a QA team
	- Input validation
		- Validate actual vs. expected
		- Zod (javascript) for example
		- Document all possible input methods
			- Forms, fields, type
		- Check and correct all input (normalization)
			- A zip code should be only X characters long
			- No input should have <>; and similar characters
				- That helps against injection
			- Fix any data with improper input or return an error
		- The fuzzers will find what you missed
	- Secure cookies
		- Used for tracking, personalization, session managements
		- Secure cookies have a Secure attribute set
			- Browser will only send it over HTTPS (encrypted)
		- Sensitive information should NEVER be saved on cookies
			- Everything on cookies can be read from browser
	- SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
		- Automated test that finds security vulnerabilities
		- Buffer overflows, database injections etc.
		- Not everything can be identified through auto analysis
			- Authentication security and insecure cryptography are examples
			- Don't rely on automation for everything
		- Talk to your DevOps
		- A human still have to verify each finding
			- A lot of false positives or false negatives, check it yourself and analyse it
	- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
		- Non-automated test that finds security vulnerabilities
		- Pentesting!
	- Code signing
		- To check if an app has been modified in any way you can confirm through the CA
		- The app code can be digitally signed by the developer
			- Asymmetric encryption
			- A trusted CA signs the developer's public key
			- Developer signs the code with their private key
			- For internal apps, you your own CA
	- Sandboxing
		- Applications cannot access unrelated resources
		- Commonly using during development
		- Used in many different deployments
			- VMs
			- Mobile devices
			- Browser iframes
			- Windows User Account Control (UAC)
	- Application security monitoring
		- Real-time info
		- View blocked attacks
		- Audit the logs
		- Anomaly detections
		- Think of SIEMs
