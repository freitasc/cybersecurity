## What is it?

- Where to spend time and effort in securing something
- Hardening guides are specific to the software or platform
## Additional Information

- Mobile devices
	- Always connected mobile tech
	- Updates are critical
	- Segmentation can protect data
		- Company and user data is separated
	- Mobile Device Manager (MDM) is key
		- A centralized solution where IT department can monitor and manage devices
		- Usually it is standard on company issued technology
		- Sometimes it is also applied on employee-owned devices
- Workstations
	- Desktops and laptops
	- Constant monitoring and updates
	- Automate the monthly patches
		- There should be a process of evaluating and testing as soon as the update drops
	- Connect to a policy management system
		- Active Directory (AD) is a famous one
	- Remove unnecessary software to limit the threats
- Network infrastructure devices
	- Switches, routers etc
	- Purpose-build devices
		- Embedded OS
	- Configure auth
		- DO NOT USE THE DEFAULTS
	- Check with the manufacturer for updates
- Cloud infrastructure
	- Secure the cloud management workstation
	- Least privilage
		- All services, network settings, app rights and permissions should be on minimum
	- Configure EDR
		- All devices (endpoints) accessing the cloud should be secure
	- Always have backups
		- Cloud to Cloud (C2C)
- Servers
	- Many and varied
		- Windows, Linux etc
	- Updates always
	- User accounts should be hardened
		- Minimum password lengths and complexity
		- Account limitations
	- Network access and security
		- Limit network access
	- Monitor and secure
		- EDR, AV, firewalls
- SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System)
	- Industrial, PC manages equipment
		- Power generation, refining, manufacturing
	- Distributed control systems
	- Require extensive segmentation
		- No access from the outside
	- Usually very secure
- Embedded systems
	- Can be difficult to upgrade
	- Correct vulnerabilities
		- Security patches remove threats
	- Segment and firewall
- RTOS (Real-time Operating System)
	- An operating system with a deterministic processing schedule
		- Industrial, cars, military equipment
	- Isolate the system
	- Run with minimum services
		- Prevent exploits
	- Use secure communication
		- Protect with host-based firewall
- IoT devices
	- Heating and cooling, lighting, home automation
	- Weak defaults, CHANGE THE DEFAULTS
	- Deploy updates as quickly as possible
	- Segmentating
		- Put IoT devices on their own VLAN
