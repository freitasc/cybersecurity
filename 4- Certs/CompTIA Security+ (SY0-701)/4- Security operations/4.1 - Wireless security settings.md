## What is it?

- Configs and settings regarding the security of wireless devices
## Additional Information

- WPA2 has a PSK brute-force problem
	- If you listen to the four-way handshake
	- Capture the hash
	- With the hash. brute force your way into the pre-shared key (PSK)
	- This has become easier as tech improves
		- GPU processing
		- Cloud-based password cracking
	- Once you have the PSK, you can just connect to the network
- WPA3 and GCMP are the new standard
	- WPA3 was introduced in 2018
	- Using GCMP (Galois/Counter Mode Protocol) block cipher mode
		- Data confidentiality with AES
		- Message Integrity Check (MIC) with Galois Message Authentication Code (GMAC)
	- WPA3 changes the PSK auth process
		- Includes mutual auth
		- Creates a shared session key without sending that key across the net
		- NO MORE FOUR WAY HANDSHAKES!
			- No hashes, no brute force
	- Simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE)
		- A Diffie-Hellman derived key exchange with an authentication component
		- Everyone uses a different session key, even with the same PSK
		- An IEEE standard - the dragonfly handshake

- If your wifi uses 1 password it is PSK
	- "Personal"
- If your wifi uses multiple passwords and logins for each person, it is 802.1X
	- "Enterprise"
