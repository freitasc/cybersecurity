## What is it?

- How to deal with info and how to discern between false and truthful information
- Positives, negatives, false positives, false negatives

## Additional Information

- A low-severity vulnerability is not a false positive
- And a false negative (never showed up) doesn't mean it doesn't exist
- Update to the latest signature in your detector for better results

- You should prioritize them in order or criticality
- Refer to public disclosed and databases (A CVE LIST)
	- https://nvd.nist.gov/
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)
	- Quantitative scoring of a vulnerability
	- The scoring standards change over time
	- Different scoring for CVSS 2.0 vs CVSS 3.x
- CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
	- https://cve.mitre.org/cve/
- Some vulnerabilities cannot be definitively identified
	- The scanner gives you a heads up
	- But you will have to check manually and go read the database for similarities
- Vulnerability classification
	- Update your shit always
	- Application scans
	- Webapp scans
	- Network scans
- Exposure factor
	- Loss of value or business activity if the vulnerability is exploited
	- A small DDoS may limit access to a service
	- A buffer overflow may completely disable a service
	- Consider this when prioritizing
- Environmental variables
	- Internal, public cloud, test lab
	- Prioritize based on this is useful
		- A device is isolated on the lab goes to the bottom of the list
		- A database in production is VERY DANGEROUS
- Risk tolerance
	- The amount of risk acceptable to an organization
	- It is impractical to remove all risk (maybe impossible)
	- Testing takes time, so does patching
