## What is it?

- What to do after finding a vulnerability

## Additional Information

- Patching
	- The most common mitigation
	- Update it and fix the issue by changing the affected code
	- Sometimes it is scheduled
		- Daily, Weekly, Monthly
		- Big tech manufacturers, online game developers and others 
	- Sometimes it is not
		- Small tech companies, IoT manufacturers
	- And sometimes unscheduled patches are sent
		- Zero days, urgent and critical vulnerabilities
- Cybersecurity Insurance Coverage
	- Lost revenue
	- Data recovery costs
	- Money lost to phishing or ransomware
	- Privacy lawsuit costs
	- DOESNT COVER EVERYTHING
	- Because of this, ransomware has became incredibly lucrative
		- The company wont even lose any real money!
		- The insurance will definitely pay the attackers since it will cost less for them than then consequences of not paying
- Segmentation
	- Limit the scope of an exploit
	- A breach will have limited scope
	- Can't patch? Isolate it
		- A great example is banking systems made in COBOL
	- Use internal NGFWs
- Compensating controls
	- Optimal security may not be available, then you need to compensate it
	- Disable the problematic service
	- Revoke access to the app
	- Limit external access
	- Modify internal security controls and software firewalls
- Validation
	- The vulnerability was patched, what know?
	- Rescan it
	- Audit it
	- Verify it, manually if necessary (pentest maybe)
- Reporting
	- After everything was done, document it
	- It is a continuous never ending effort
