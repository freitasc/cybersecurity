## What is it?

- A minimally invasive way to check for security in-depth
- Should be tested both from outside and inside
- Black box, white box and grey box
## Additional Information

- Identify systems
- Gather as much info as possible
- Port Scan
	- Poke around to see what's open
	- NMAP
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
	- Auto test a code for commonly known vulnerabilities
		- Buffer overflow, database injections, API keys within the code etc
	- Must be analyzed by an actual developer to see if its a false positive or not
	- Cant test for everything
		- Authentication Security, insecure cryptography etc
		- Don't rely on automation for everything
	- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
		- Non-automated test that finds security vulnerabilities
		- Pentesting
		- Fuzzing
			- Send random input to an app
			- Fault-injecting, robustness testing, syntax testing, negative testing
			- Looking for something out of the ordinary
				- App crash, server error, exception
			- Fuzzing engines and frameworks are common now
				- Very time and processor resource heavy
					- Many, many different iterations at the same time
					- Many fuzzing engines use high-probability tests
				- CERT BFF is a good example
	- SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
		- Some apps are distributed in packages
			- and some packages "pull" other packages
			- that is very susceptible to supply chain attacks
		- Confirm the package is legitimate
		- SCAs are solutions that automatically test the required libs and packages needed to run your app
			- They check for known vulnerabilities on those libraries
			- They also check for versions and most of them recommend the newest or more stable version
	- IaC (Infrastructure as Code) Scanning
		- Analyzes configuration files (Terraform, CloudFormation, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests) looking for misconfigurations.
		- Misconfigurations on the infrastructure could be means for an attacker
			- VM escapes
			- Docker hijacking
			- Kubernetes exploiting
			- and many many others
