		- Applications
			- Availability - uptime and response time
			- Data transfers - increases or decreases in rates

- Scanning
	- Everything is constantly changing so keep it updated
	- Actively automatically check system and devices
	- Gather the raw details in a readable format

- Use a SIEM to aggregate data
	- Security information and event manager
	- Centralized reporting and data aggregation from different sources
	- Correlation between diverse systems
		- This is useful to create a "case" of an attack and to measure things

- Reporting
	- Analyze the collected data and tell to someone else
	- Status information
	- Determine best next steps
	- Ad hoc information summaries

- Archiving
	- It takes an average of about 9 months for a company to identify and contain a breach
	- Access to data is critical
	- May have a mandate by state or federal law

- Alerting
	- Real-time notifications of events
	- Notify the response team
	- Act on the known data
	- But to be effective, it needs to be tuned
		- This is an ongoing ever changing process
		- The tuning gets better as time goes on and the organization matures
		- Prevent false positives and false negatives
