## What is it?

- Tools we use to secure whats important

## Additional Information

- SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)
	- https://scap.nist.gov
	- Allows tools to identify and act on the same criteria
	- SCAP content cam be shared between tools
		- Focused on configuration compliance
		- Easily detect apps with known vulnerabilities
	- Especially useful in large environment
	- This specification standard enables automation between different tools
	- Automation types:
		- Ongoing monitoring
		- Notification and alerting
		- Remediation of noncompliant systems
- Benchmarks
	- Apply security best-practices to everything
	- Example: Mobile Device
		- Disable screenshots
		- Disable screen recordings
		- Prevent voice calls when locked
		- Force encryption backups
		- Disable additional VPN profiles
		- Configure a "lost phone" message
		- etc
- Agents / Agentless
	- Check to see if the device is in compliance
		- Install a software agent on the device
		- Or run an on-demand agentless check
	- Agents can be usually provide more details (EDR/XDR)
		- Always monitoring for real-time notifications
		- Must be maintained and updated
	- Agentless runs without a formal install
		- Performs the check, the disappears
		- Does not require ongoing updates to an agent
		- Will not inform or alert if not running
- SIEM
	- Logging of security events and information
	- Log collections of security alerts
	- Log aggregation and long-term storage
	- Data correlation
	- Forensic analysis
- Anti-virus and Anti-malware
	- Malware refers to the broad malicious software category
	- The terms are effectively the same nowadays
- DLP (Data loss prevention)
	- Where's your data?
	- Stop the data before the attacker gets it
		- No data "leakage"
	- So many sources, so many destinations
		- Often requires multiple solutions
		- Endpoint clients
		- Cloud-based systems
			- Email, cloud storage, collaboration tools
- SNMP (Simple network management protocol)
	- A database of data (MIB) - management information base
	- The database contains OIDs - object identifiers
	- Poll devices over udp/161
	- Request statistics from a device
	- Poll devices at fixed intervals
		- Create a historical performance graphs
	- SNMP traps
		- Can be configured on the monitored devices
		- Communicates over udp/162
		- Set a threshold for alerts
			- If the number of CRC errors increases by 5, send a trap
			- Monitoring station can react immediately
- Netflow
	- Gather traffic statistics from all traffic flows
	- Standard collection method
	- Many products and options
	- Probe and collector
		- Probe watches network communication
		- Summary records are sent to the collector
	- Usually a separate reporting app
- Vulnerability scanners
	- Minimally invasive
	- Port scan
	- Identify systems
	- Test from the outside and inside
	- Gather as much info as possible
