## What is it?

- The protocols used for email transfer are relatively low security
## Additional Information

- Mail gateway
	- Evaluates the source of inbound email messages
	- Blocks it at the gateway before it reaches the user
	- On-site or cloud-based
- SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
	- SPF protocol
		- Sender configures a list of all servers authorized to send emails for a domain
	- List of authorized mail servers are added to a DNS TXT record
		- Receiving mail servers perform a check to see if incoming email really did come from an authorized host
- Domain Keys identified mail (DKIM)
	- A mail server digitally signs all outgoing mail
		- The public key is in the DKIM TXT record
	- The signature is validated by receiving mail servers
		- Not usually seen by the end user
- DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance)
	- An extension of SPF and DKIM together
	- The domain owner decides what receiving email servers should do with emails not validated using SPF and DKIM
	- That policy is written into a DNS TXT record
	- Accept all, send to spam, or reject the email
	- Compliance reports are sent to the email administrator
