	- Based on destination protocol and port
		- Web server: tcp/80 (http), tcp/443 (https)
		- SSH server: tcp/22
		- Microsoft RDP: tcp/3389
		- DNS query: udp/53
		- NTP: udp/123
- NGFW (Next generation firewall)
	- Layer 7 firewall (have the app context)
	- Require some advanced decodes
		- Every packet must be analyzed, categorized and a security decisions determined
- Firewall rules

	- Anomaly-based
		- Build a baseline of what's "normal"
		- Unusual traffics are blocked
	- You determine what happens when unwanted traffic appears
	- Thousands of rules
