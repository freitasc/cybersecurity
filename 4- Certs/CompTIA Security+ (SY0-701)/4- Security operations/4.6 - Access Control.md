## What is it?

- Users receive rights based on access control models
	- Different business needs or mission requirements
## Additional Information

- Least privilage
	- Rights and permissions should be set to the bare minimum
	- All users accounts must be limited
	- Don't allow users to run with admin privileges
- MAC (Mandatory Access Control)
	- The operating system limits the operation on an object
	- Every object gets a label
		- Confidential, secret, top secret etc
	- Labeling of objects uses predefined rules
		- The administrator decides who gets access to what security level
		- Users cannot change these settings nor re-label anything
- DAC (Discretionary access control)
	- Used in most operating systems
	- You create a spreadsheet
		- As the owner, you control who has access
		- You can modify access at any time
	- Very flexible access control
		- And very weak security
- RBAC (Role-based access control)
	- You have a role in your organization
		- Manager, director, team lead, project manager
	- Administrators provide access based on the role of the user
		- Rights are gained implicitly instead of explicitly
	- In windows, use Groups to provide role-based access control
- Rule-based access control
	- Generic term for following rules
	- Access is determined through system-enforced rules
	- The rule is associated with the object
	- Rule examples
		- Labe networks access in only available between 9AM and 5PM
		- Only chrome browser may complete this web form
- ABAC (Attribute-base access control)
	- Users can have complex relationships
	- ABAC can consider many parameters
		- A "next generation" authorization model
		- Aware of context
	- Combine and evaluate multiple parameters
		- Resource information, IP address, time of day, desire action, relationship to the data etc
- Time-of-day restriction
	- Almost all security devices include a time-of-day option
	- Can be difficult to implement on a multi-time zone environment
	- Time-of-day restrictions examples
		- Training room network is inaccessible between midnight and 6AM
