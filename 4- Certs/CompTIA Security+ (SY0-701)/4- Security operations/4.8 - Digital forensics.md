## What is it?

- Collect and protect information relating to an intrusion

## Additional Information

- RFC 3227 - Guidelines for Evidence Collection and Archiving
	- https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3227
- Must be detail oriented
	- Take extensive notes

- Legal hold
	- A legal technique to preserve relevant info
		- Prepare for impeding litigation
		- Initiated by a legal counsel
	- Hold notification
	- Separate repository for ESI (electronically stored information)
		- Many different data sources and types
		- Unique workflow and retention requirements
	- Ongoing preservation
- Chain-of-custody
	- Control evidence
	- Everyone who contacts the evidence
		- Use hashes and digital signatures
		- Avoid tampering
	- Label and catalog everything
		- Digitally tag all items for ongoing documentation
		- Seal and store
	- Acquisition
		- Obtain the data
		- Some of the data may not be on single system
			- Servers, network data, firewall logs
			- For virtual systems, get a snapshot
			- Look for any left-behind digital items
				- Artifacts
				- Log info, recycle bins, browser bookmarks and history, saved logins etc
- Reporting
	- Document the findings
	- Summary information
	- Detailed explanation of data acquisition
	- The findings
	- Conclusions
- Preservation
	- Handling evidence
		- Isolate and protect the data
		- Analyze the data later without any alterations
	- Manage the collection process
		- Work from copies
		- Manage the data collection from mobile devices
	- Live collection has become an important skill
		- Data may be encrypted or difficult to collect after powering down
	- Follow best practices to ensure admissibility of data in court
- E-discovery
	- Electronic discovery
		- Collect, prepare, review, interpret and produce electronic documents
	- E-discovery gathers data required by legal process
		- Does not generally involve analysis
		- There's no consideration of intent
	- Works together with digital forensics
		- The e-discovery process obtains a storage drive
		- Data on the drive is smaller than expected
		- Forensics experts determine that data was deleted and attempt to recover the data
