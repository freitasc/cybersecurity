## Additional Information

- NIST SP800-61
	- Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
	- https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/61/r2/final
- Preparing for an incident
	- Communication methods
		- Phones and contact info
	- Incident handling hardware and software
		- Laptops, removable media, forensics software etc
	- Incident resources
		- Documentation, network diagrams, baselines, critical file hash values
	- Incident mitigation software
		- Clean OS and application images
	- Policies needed for incident handling
- The challenge of detection[
	- Many different detection sources
	- A large amount of "volume"
	- Incidents are almost always complex
- Analysis
	- An incident might occur in the future
		- Web server log
			- Vulnerability scanner in use
		- Exploit announcement
			- Monthly microsoft patch release, adobe PDF software update etc
		- Direct threats
			- A hacking group doesn't like you
	- An attack is underway
		- Buffer overflow attempt
		- Anti-virus software identifies malware
		- Host-based monitor detects a configuration change
		- Network traffic flows deviate from the norm
- Isolation and containment
	- Generally a bad idea to let things run their course
	- Sandboxes
		- An isolated operating system
		- Run malware and analyze the results
		- Clean out the sandbox when done
		- Isolation can be sometimes be problematic
			- Malware or infections can monitor connectivity
			- When connectivity is lost, everything could be deleted / encrypted
- Recovery after an incident
	- Get things back to normal
		- Remove the bad, keep the good
	- Recover the system
		- Restore from backups
		- Rebuild from scratch
		- Replace compromised files
		- Tighten down the perimeter
- Lessons learned
	- Learn and improve
	- Post-incident meeting
	- Don't wait too long
	- Document everything
- Training for an incident
	- There's limited on-the-job training
	- Train the team prior to an incident
	- This can be expensive with larger response teams
