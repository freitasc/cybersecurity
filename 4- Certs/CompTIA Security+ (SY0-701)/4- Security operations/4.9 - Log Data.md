## What is it?

- Automatic and chronological digital records of events that occur within a system

## Additional Information

- Security log files
	- Detailed security-related info
	- Critical security information
		- Documentation of every traffic flow
		- Summary of attack info
		- Correlate with other logs (SIEM)
	- Firewall logs
		- Traffic flows through the firewall
		- Source/destination IP, port numbers, dispositions
		- NGFW
			- Logs the apps used
			- URL filtering categories
			- Anomalies and suspicious actions
	- Application logs
		- Specific to the app
		- Windows
			- Event viewer / Application Log
		- Linux / macOS
			- /var/log
		- Parse the log details on the SIEM
	- Endpoint Logs
		- Attackers often gain access to endpoints
		- There's a lot of data on the endpooint
			- Logon events, policy changes, system events, processes, account management, directory services etc
		- Everything rolls up to the SIEM
		- Use with correlation of other security events
	- OS-specific security logs
		- Monitoring apps
		- Brute force, file changes
		- Authentication details
		- Disabled services
	- IPS/IDS logs
		- Usually integrated into an NGFW
		- Logs contain information about predefined vulnerabilities
		- Common data points
			- Timestamp
			- Type or class of attack
			- Source and destination IP
			- Source and destination port
	- Network logs
		- Switches, routers, access points, VPN concentrators
		- Network changes

		- Mobile
			- Type of phone, GPS location
		- Web
			- OS, browser type, IP
		- Files
			- Name, address, phone number, title
	- Vulnerability scan
		- No firewall
		- No anti-virus
		- No anti-spyware
		- Misconfigurations
		- Open shares
		- Guest access
	- Automated reports
		- Most SIEMs include a report generator
			- Automate common security reports
		- May be easy or complex to create
			- The SIEM may have its own report generator
			- Third party report generators may be able to access the database
		- Requires human intervention
	- Dashboards
		- Real-time status information
		- Add or remove information
		- Shows the most important data
	- Packet capture
		- Solve complex application issues
		- Gathers packets on the network
