## What is it?

 - The structured process of identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing potential future events that could negatively impact an organization, project, or investment
## Additional Information

- Qualitative risk assessment
	- Identify significant risk factors
		- Ask opinions about the significance
		- Display visually with traffic light grid or similar method
		- ![[Pasted image 20260210111424.png]]
- Quantitative risk assessment
	- ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence)
		- How likely is it that a hurricane will hit?
	- AV (Asset Value)
		- The value of the asset to the organization
		- Includes the cost of the asset, the effect on company sales, potential regulatory fines, etc
	- EF (Exposure factor)
		- The percentage of the value lost due to an incident
		- Losing a quarter of the value is .25
		- Losing the entire asset is 1.0
	- SLE (Single Loss Expectancy)
		- What is the monetary loss if a single event occurs
		- Asset Value (AV) x Exposure Factor (EF)
		- Laptop stolen = 1000 (AV) x 1.0 (EF) = 1000 (SLE)
	- ALE (Annualized Loss Expectancy)
		- Annualized rate of occurrence (ARO) x Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
		- Seven laptops stolen a year (ARO) x 1000 (SLE) = 7000
- The business impact can be more than monetary
	-  Quantitative vs. Qualitative
- Impact
	- Life
		- The most important consideration
	- Property
		- The risk to building and assets
	- Safety
		- Some environments are too dangerous to work
	- Finance
		- The resulting financial cost
- Likelihood and probability
	- Risk likelihood
		- A qualitative measurement of risk
		- Rare, possible, almost certain etc
	- Risk probability
		- A quantitative measurement of risk
		- A statistical measurement
		- Can be based on historical performance
	- Often considered similar in scope
		- Can be used interchangeably in casual conversation
- Risk appetite and tolerance
	- Risk appetite
		- A broad definition of risk-taking deemed acceptable
		- The amount of accepted risk before taking any action to reduce that risk
	- Risk appetite posture
		- Qualitative description for readiness to take risk
		- Conservative, neutral and expansionary
		- Conservative
			- Trying to reduce the risks, even by means of reducing gain margin
		- Expansionary
	- Risk tolerance 
		- An acceptable variance (usually larger) from the risk appetite
	- Risk appetite vs tolerance
		- A highway's speed limit is the risk appetite
		- If you go above it you are in an unacceptable balance between safety and convenience
		- If we go above the speed limit and don't get ticketed, our law enforcement has a bigger risk tolerance than risk appetite
		- This tolerance can change with road conditions, weather, traffic etc
	- Risk register
		- Every project has a plan, but also has a risk
			- Identify and document the risk associated with each step
			- Apply possible solutions to the identified risks
			- Monitor the results
		- Key risk indicators
			- Identify risks that could impact the organization
		- Risk owners
			- Each indicator is assigned someone to manage the risk
		- Risk threshold
			- The cost of mitigation is at least equal to the value gained by mitigation
