- #### Asymmetric encryption
	- Public key cryptography
		- Two (or more) mathematically related keys
	- Private Key
		- Keep this private
		- THE PRIVATE KEY IS THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN DECRYPT DATA ENCRYPTED WITH THE PUBLIC KEY
		- You can't derive the private key from the public key
	- Public key
		- Anyone can see this key, Give it away
		- THE PUBLIC KEY CAN ENCRYPT DATA THAT CAN ONLY BE DECRYPTED WITH THE PRIVATE KEY
		- You can't derive the public key from the private key
	- The key pair
		- Asymmetric encryption
			- Public Key cryptography
		- Key generation
			- Builds both the public and the private key at the same time using a lot of math
			- Lots of randomization
			- Large prime numbers
		- Everyone can have the public key, only you can have the private key.
