- A single, shared key
	- Encrypt, with the key
	- Decrypt with the same key
	- If it gets out, you'll need another key
- Secret Key Algorithm
	- A shared secret
- Doesnt scale very well
	- Can be challenging to distribute
- Very fast to use
	- Less overhead that asymmetric encryption
	- Often combined with asymmetric encryption
